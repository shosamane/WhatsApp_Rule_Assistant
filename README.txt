Transcript Eligibility Requirements
----------------------------------
To run the experiment, the uploaded WhatsApp chat export must meet all of the following:

- Time span: at least 90 days between the earliest and latest message timestamps.
- Total volume: at least 500 messages in the transcript.
- Participants: at least 3 unique participants (system messages do not count).
- Recent activity: at least 50 messages in the last 30 days (relative to the latest message).

If any of these are not met, the app will block rule generation and show which criteria the transcript violates with the current values.

Notes
- Upload either a folder export or a .zip export that contains the chat .txt file (media files are ignored).
- The app supports iOS (bracket format) and Android (hyphen format) exports and handles multi‑line messages and common WhatsApp quirks.
