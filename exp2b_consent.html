      <p>This is an academic study conducted by researchers at Cornell University and Rutgers University.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Purpose:</strong></h4>
      <p>In this study, we examine the quality of rules created for WhatsApp groups with and without AI assistance.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Study Procedure:</strong></h4>
      <p>If you agree to participate, you will need to complete an 8-12 minute online task:</p>
      <p>In this task, you will see 10 pairs of rules written by other participants for the same WhatsApp family group chat you read earlier.</p>
      <p><strong>For each pair, you'll compare them on five aspects:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Which rules are easier to understand and less ambiguous?</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual Fit:</strong> Which rules better address the actual problems that occurred in the chat (the political argument, the unknown number, profanity, product spam)?</li>
        <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Are the rules written in a style appropriate for a family group?</li>
        <li><strong>Enforceability:</strong> As a group admin, which rules would make it easier to identify violations and take action?</li>
        <li><strong>Perceived Legitimacy:</strong> Which rules would you be more willing to follow if they were posted in your family WhatsApp group?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Neither set of rules is your own. Choose based on your honest judgment. It's okay to select "Equal" if you genuinely can't decide.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Eligibility:</strong></h4>
      <p>You must have completed the previous WhatsApp rule-writing study to participate in this follow-up task.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Risks:</strong></h4>
      <p>We expect minimal risk from your participation in this study. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, you can withdraw.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Benefits</strong></h4>
      <p>No direct benefits. Your participation potentially helps improve WhatsApp group features.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Compensation</strong></h4>
      <p>You will receive $3.00 USD (~270 INR) via Prolific/Clickworker if you complete the study.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Confidentiality</strong></h4>
      <p>Your identity and data are protected. We will only collect your Prolific/Clickworker ID to process compensation. All data will be encrypted and accessed by the research team only.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Voluntary participation</strong></h4>
      <p>Participation is voluntary. You may withdraw anytime by closing your browser. At this moment, we can only compensate those who complete the whole study.</p>
